Measuring: Voltage, Current, Motor Speed, Motor Torque

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Voltage: Measured with voltmeter just before motor, passed through voltage divider

Current: Measured using shunt resistor and dual voltmeters passed through voltage dividers

Motor Speed: Measured using encoder and microcontroller timer

Motor Torque: Measured using disc brake and spring scale
	Disc brake mounts to wood frame
	Brake rotor with custom hub mounts to motor axle
	Connect paracord to brake cable
	Spring scale attaches to paracord and eyebolt on particle board
	
Braking Torque: Calculated using spring scale reading
	Empirically determine relationship between cable tension and friction
	Compute torque from friction
