Measuring: Voltage, Current, Motor Speed, Motor Torque

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Voltage: Assumed based on power supply output, indicated using pogo pin 

Current: Measured using clamp-on ammeter before motor

Motor Speed: Measured using encoder and microcontroller timer

Motor Torque: Measured using disc brake, pulley, 393 motor, and Vex encoder
	Disc brake mounts to wood frame
	Brake rotor with custom hub mounts to motor axle
	Disc brake cable forms short loop (soldered/welded)
	1/8" string attachs to brake cable via loop
	Other end of string attaches to Vex winch with block-and-tackle reduction
	Vex winch attaches via axle to 393 motor and encoder
	
Braking Torque: Calculated using rotation of Vex winch
	Empirical testing of kinetic friction to develop model
		Kinetic friction as a function of winch rotational displacement
